\section{Product Release}

Our product can be cloned from https://github.com/jemisonf/mdrender.

To use, clone the github repository. You can then use UNIX Make in any of the non-googletest folders to build the components there. For example, running "make" in the filedata folder will compile the MdData and TextNode components. If you enter the interface folder and compile, you can run the current iteration of the command line application.
